ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NSPC911, the coding alt of NSPG911!

ðŸŽ® Games I play:
<details>
<summary>Minecraft</summary>
  - Clearly I play Minecraft because look at my profile 
  - Repositories related to it:
    1. [Clear Vanilla](https://github.com/NSPC911/Clear-Vanilla)
       - Clear Vanilla is a Utility Pack that makes any blockstate visible.
       - I have not made a showcase of my modifications, but [@Tal](https://www.twitter.com/melamed_tal) made a [showcase](https://youtu.be/902-uZEKABY) on the original pack
    2. [High Contrast BE](https://github.com/NSPC911/High-Contrast-BE)
       - A port of the High Contrast UI released back in [Java 1.19.4 Pre-Release 1](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-19-4-pre-release-1).
       - Simplexity Devlopment made an [extended version](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/high-contrast-extended) that supports all UI elements
       - I loved it, so I guess I ported it
    3. [Modules Plus](https://github.com/NSPC911/Modules-Plus)
       - A patched version of Chainsketch's Modules+ pack
       - It broke in 1.19.50 due to changes in the Emote Screen
       - There was a change in the name of the UI control, so I fixed it.
       - [Vierous](https://github.com/Bereallmao) helped fix it to 1.20.0
       - However, it apparently broke in 1.20.20, not exactly sure why
       - It was painful to always fix it per update, so it is currently archived
    4. [Modules Plus Preset Loader](https://github.com/NSPC911/Modules-Plus-Preset-Loader)
       - A patched version of the Preset Loader for Modules Plus
       - load.config was modified, so I had to make this

Current project:
<details>
<summary>[Bedrock Tweaks Base](https://github.com/NSPC911/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base)</summary>
  - A continuation of Bedrock Tweaks that should support 1.20 as DrAv has not updated Bedrock Tweaks.
  - DrAv apparently is doing something, though I am not sure what.
  - Since I am bored, I am doing this I guess
  - Currently, I plan for it to use a Python-based TUI. I have no experience in HTML and Javascript, so I won't make a website of it.
